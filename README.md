# EECR
Emotion-guided Augmented Dialogue Recommender System, in this paper, we recommend suitable items for users by filtering the items of entities by analyzing the emotional semantics of the discourse. We use a combination of roberta and comet to enhance the sentiment semantics and use cue templates to get sentiment scores for entities.
