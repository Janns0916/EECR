Sentimentally Enhanced Conversation Recommender System, in this paper, we recommend suitable items for users by filtering the entities' items by analyzing the discourse's emotional semantics. We use a combination of Roberta and Comet to enhance the sentiment semantics and cue templates to get sentiment scores for entities.
